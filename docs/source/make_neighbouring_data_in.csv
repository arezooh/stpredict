| **details:** a data frame or address of a data frame containing
| temporal or spatial covariates and the id of spatial (and temporal)
| units.
| The *data* must include the following columns with names in the
| specified format in the description, or if the columns have arbitrary
| names their content must be specified using the *column_identifier*
| argument.
| 
| 
| Spatial id:
| The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input data must be
| included in the *data* with the name 'spatial id level 1'. The spatial
| id must have unique values.
| 
| Temporal ids:
| If data is time-dependent (i.e., *time_dependency_flag* = 1),  the id of
| the temporal units recorded in the input data must be included in the 
| *data* with the column name 'temporal id'. The temporal ids must have 
| unique values and a sortable format. The time dimension of data can
| also be specified in multiple scales (e.g., hour, min, sec). In that case,
| each scale must have a separate temporal id with a column name of
| the format 'temporal id level x', where 'x' is the corresponding temporal
| scale level, starting with level 1 for the smallest scale (e.g. sec). The
| combination of these temporal scale levels' ids should form a unique
| identifier.
| 
| All the remaining columns are considered as covariates except those
| with names of the format 'spatial id level x' or 'temporal id level x'
| where x is the level of the corresponding spatial or temporal scale."

| **details:** If the input *data* column names do not match the
| specific format of temporal and spatial ids and covariates (i.e.,
| 'temporal id', 'temporal id level x', 'spatial id level x'),
| a dictionary must be passed to specify the content of each column.
| 
| Keys must be a string in one of the formats: {'temporal id',
| 'temporal id level x','spatial id level x'}
| The values of 'temporal id level x' and 'spatial id level x' should be 
| the names of the columns containing the temporal and spatial ids
| in the x scale level respectively. If the input data has only one 
| temporal scale, the name of the column including the temporal ids
| must be specified with the key 'temporal id'.

| 'year','spatial id level 1': 'county_fips', 'spatial id level 2':
| 'state_fips'}"

| Each neighbouring layer for a spatial unit includes neighbours with
| a certain distance from this spatial unit. The first layer contains
| adjacent neighbours, the second layer contains neighbours with a
| distance of one spatial unit, and so on for other layers. For each
| covariate, the average values of this covariate in the spatial units
| included in a neighbouring layer are added to the data as a new 
| covariate. Therefore, neighbouring_layers = n, for each covariate, 
| adds n new covariates to the data."

| in the rows and columns of the matrix should be based on their spatial
| id order (numerical order for numeric ids or lexicographical order for
