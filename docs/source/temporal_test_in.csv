| **details:** a data frame containing target variable. or its address.
| 
| The data must includes following columns:
| 
| Spatial ids: The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input
| data must be included in the *data* in a column with the name 'spatial
| id level 1'.
| 
| Temporal ids: The id of time units recorded in the input data for each
| temporal scale must be included as a separate column in the *data*
| with a name in a format 'temporal id level x', where 'x' is the
| related temporal scale level beginning with level 1 for the smallest
| scale. The temporal units could have a free but sortable format like
| year number, week number and so on. The combination of these
| temporal scale levels' ids should form a unique identifier. However the
| integrated format of date and time is also supported. In the case of
| using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale must be
| included in the *data* with the column name of 'temporal id'. The
| expected format of each scale is shown in :numref:`target tab 1`.

| 
| Note that only one spatial unit should be specified for the ACF

| 
| 'ADF':
| The augmented dickey-fuller (ADF) test is performed to check if
| the target variable is a stationary time series.
| 
| 'ACF':
| The autocorrelation function is plotted for specified *lags*. The 
| resulting plot depicts correlation (vertical axis) against lag 
| (horisontal axis).
| 
| 'autoreg':
| An autoregressive model is fitted to the target variable values 
| with specified *lags* to obtain coefficients."

| passed to specify the content of each column.
| The keys must be a string in one of the formats: {'temporal

| The values of 'temporal id level x' and 'spatial id level x' must be
| the name of the column containing the temporal or spatial ids in the
| scale level x respectively.
| If the input data have integrated format for temporal ids, the name of
| the corresponding column must be specified with the key 'temporal
